Role: Implementer
Writes only inside components/<Name>/{api/,service/,domain/,adapters/,schemas/,tests/,LLD.md}.
Implement service.preview() (NO external mutations) and service.execute() via adapters. Keep handlers thin.
Update/author JSON Schemas under components/<Name>/schemas/. Update tests. Never commit secrets. Never push to main.
Definition of Done = tests green + SPEC/LLD still satisfied.
