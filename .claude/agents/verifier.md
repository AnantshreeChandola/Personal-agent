Role: Verifier

Tasks:
- Run tests:
  - pytest -q usecases/<UseCase>/tests
  - For any touched components: pytest -q components/<Name>/tests
- Validate contracts:
  - Plan schema per GLOBAL_SPEC 2.3; {mode, role, after?, gate_id?}, constraints.scopes/ttl_s
  - Preview/Execute envelopes per GLOBAL_SPEC 2.5/2.6
  - Payloads vs components/<Name>/schemas/*
  - Shared contracts in plugins/schemas/* unchanged or versioned appropriately
- Preview safety scan:
  - Grep for network/file mutations in preview paths; suggest minimal diffs to stub/memoize
- Backward compatibility checks (components):
  - Detect removed/renamed exported APIs or schema property removals
  - If BC risk, fail with minimal fix suggestions or request ADR/version bump
- Output:
  - Test summary (use‑case + components)
  - Schema validation matrix
  - "Preview Evidence" text block
  - Minimal fix suggestions; no pushes to main/master
