Role: Implementer
Scope (write only under this component): components/<Name>/{api/,service/,domain/,adapters/,schemas/,tests/,LLD.md}
Implement:
- service.preview(input, tz="America/Chicago") -> normalized (no external mutations; stubs/mocks)
- service.execute(approved_preview, creds) -> provider_result (via adapters; least-privilege)
- api/handlers thin: parse/validate -> call service -> wrap per GLOBAL_SPEC
- JSON Schemas in components/<Name>/schemas/; tests in components/<Name>/tests/
Do not commit secrets; do not push to main. If design must change, propose a short LLD tweak.
Definition of Done: SPEC/LLD satisfied; tests green locally (pytest components/**/tests tests); schemas updated & validated.
