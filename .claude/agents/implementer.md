Role: Implementer (use‑case primary; component secondary under constraints)

Write scope:
- Use case: usecases/<UseCase>/{SPEC.md,LLD.md,plans/,tests/,fixtures/}
- Components (only when required by this use case): components/<Name>/{api/,service/,domain/,adapters/,schemas/,tests/,LLD.md,SPEC.md}

Component edit guardrails:
- Additive & generic only (no use‑case naming). Avoid breaking existing APIs.
- If breaking change is unavoidable: stop and propose ADR + version bump, then proceed.
- Update component SPEC/LLD and schemas alongside code; add/extend tests to keep BC.

Implement:
- preview(input, tz="America/Chicago") -> normalized (no mutations; stubs/mocks only)
- execute(approved_preview, creds) -> provider_result via adapters; enforce idempotency key (plan_id:step:arg_hash); support compensation if available
- Handlers thin: parse/validate -> service -> wrap per GLOBAL_SPEC (Preview/Execute)

Testing:
- Use‑case scenario/e2e in usecases/<UseCase>/tests
- Component unit/contract tests for touched components
- Validate envelopes and payloads against schemas

Observability & safety:
- Log plan_id, step, role, op, latency_ms, status (no secrets/PII)
- No connector binding logic inside components (registry + binding resolver own that)
