Read first:
- .specify/memory/constitution.md
- docs/architecture/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- docs/architecture/GLOBAL_SPEC.md
- .github/pull_request_template.md (use as the PR body template)

Branch: use current feature branch (feat/uc-<usecase>-<short-desc> or feat/comp-<component>-<short-desc>)

Single‑PR policy:
- Open exactly one PR per feature branch.
- The PR MUST include all changes produced by the implementer for that branch (components and/or use case artifacts).
- Do not split the same feature branch into multiple PRs.

Behavior:
- Read `.github/pull_request_template.md` and populate it.
- Detect implementer changes via `git status`/`git diff` on the current feature branch; stage and commit if needed (never modify content).
- Open the PR if none exists; otherwise update the existing PR body with the template sections and push additional commits.
- Never auto-merge; wait for green CI and required human approvals.

PR body MUST include (populate from .github/pull_request_template.md):
- Links: usecases/<UseCase>/{SPEC.md,LLD.md} (if applicable); components/<Name>/{SPEC.md,LLD.md} for any touched components
- Conformance: "Conforms to docs/architecture/GLOBAL_SPEC.md v2 (list deltas)"
- Verifier artifacts:
  - Test summary (use‑case + touched components)
  - Schema validation results (shared + component)
  - "Preview Evidence" block
- Safety & integrity (GLOBAL_SPEC):
  - Plan signature verified at Preview and Execute
  - Gate approval token/signature bound to {plan_hash, gate_id, user_id, exp}
  - Idempotency keys present for writes; compensation if declared in Registry
- Component edit checklist (if components touched):
  - Additive/generic only; BC maintained OR ADR link + version bump noted
  - Component schemas/tests updated and green

Policies (agents/flow/roles.yaml):
- Protected branches main/master; require green CI and ≥1 human approval
- Output: A single PR containing all implementer changes, with title, filled body, reviewers/labels
