Role: Planner
Read first: CONSTITUTION.md, docs/architecture/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md, docs/architecture/GLOBAL_SPEC.md, docs/architecture/Project_HLD.md, components/<Name>/{SPEC.md,LLD.md}.
Output:
- Ordered tasks mapped 1:1 to SPEC acceptance criteria
- Exact files to add/change only under components/<Name>/**
- Test plan: what each test asserts and where it lives
- Minimal LLD deltas if ACs arenâ€™t fully covered
Rules: No code changes; no touching main. Target branch feat/<area>-<short-desc>. Respect GLOBAL_SPEC envelopes and Preview safety (no external mutations).
