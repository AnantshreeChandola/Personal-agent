Role: Planner (dev-time, coding plan)

Read first (in order):
1. .specify/memory/constitution.md (PR rules, CI gates)
2. docs/architecture/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md (component-first structure)
3. docs/architecture/GLOBAL_SPEC.md (Intent + Preview/Execute envelopes)
4. docs/architecture/Project_HLD.md (system context, 4 layers, 16 components)
5. docs/architecture/MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE.md (blast radius, fault isolation)
6. components/<Name>/SPEC.md (or usecases/<UseCase>/SPEC.md)
7. components/<Name>/LLD.md (includes dependencies, architectural considerations)
8. components/<Name>/dependencies.md (library deps, external services, internal deps)

Output Format:
Write `components/<Name>/tasks.md` (or `usecases/<UseCase>/tasks.md`) with the following structure:

```markdown
# Tasks: <ComponentName>

**Created**: <date>
**Branch**: feat/<area>-<short-desc>
**SPEC**: components/<Name>/SPEC.md
**LLD**: components/<Name>/LLD.md

## Task Organization

Tasks are organized by implementation phase, following the LLD architecture.

---

## Phase 0: Setup & Dependencies

### Install Dependencies (from dependencies.md)
- [ ] [T000] Install Python packages: pydantic, httpx, etc.
- [ ] [T001] Verify external service access (if applicable)
- [ ] [T002] Set up internal component dependencies

---

## Phase 1: Schemas & Domain (Foundation)

### Acceptance Criterion: AC-001 - <description from SPEC>

- [ ] [T100] Create response.normalized.json schema (components/<Name>/schemas/)
- [ ] [T101] Create domain models (components/<Name>/domain/)
- [ ] [T102] Write schema validation tests (tests/test_schemas.py)

---

## Phase 2: Service Layer (Business Logic)

### Acceptance Criterion: AC-002 - <description from SPEC>

- [ ] [T200] Implement service.preview() (components/<Name>/service/preview.py)
  - Reads from ProfileStore, ContextRAG
  - Normalizes output to response.normalized.json
  - NO external mutations (preview safety)
- [ ] [T201] Implement service.execute() (components/<Name>/service/execute.py)
  - Calls provider adapters
  - Idempotency: plan_id:step:arg_hash
  - Returns provider result + status
- [ ] [T202] Write service tests (tests/test_service.py)

---

## Phase 3: Adapters (External Integrations)

### Acceptance Criterion: AC-003 - <description from SPEC>

- [ ] [T300] Create provider adapter (components/<Name>/adapters/<provider>.py)
  - Implement required scopes (from dependencies.md)
  - Add circuit breaker (blast radius containment)
  - Add retry/backoff logic
- [ ] [T301] Write adapter tests with mocks (tests/test_adapters.py)

---

## Phase 4: API Handlers (Thin Wrappers)

### Acceptance Criterion: AC-004 - <description from SPEC>

- [ ] [T400] Create API handler (components/<Name>/api/handler.py)
  - Thin wrapper, delegates to service
  - Validates Intent input
  - Returns Preview or Execute wrapper
- [ ] [T401] Write handler tests (tests/test_handler.py)

---

## Phase 5: Fault Isolation & Safety (Architectural)

### From MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE.md and LLD Architectural Considerations

- [ ] [T500] Implement circuit breaker for provider calls
- [ ] [T501] Add fallback behavior for adapter failures
- [ ] [T502] Validate determinism: same inputs → same preview outputs
- [ ] [T503] Add structured logging (correlation: plan_id/step/role)
- [ ] [T504] Verify no PII in logs

---

## Phase 6: Contract Tests & Integration

### Acceptance Criterion: AC-005 - <description from SPEC>

- [ ] [T600] Write contract tests (tests/test_contract.py)
  - Test Intent → Preview → Execute flow
  - Test error paths
  - Test idempotency
- [ ] [T601] Integration test with ProfileStore, ContextRAG
- [ ] [T602] Validate GLOBAL_SPEC envelope conformance

---

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: <count>
- **Setup**: T000-T002 (3 tasks)
- **Schemas**: T100-T102 (3 tasks)
- **Service**: T200-T202 (3 tasks)
- **Adapters**: T300-T301 (2 tasks)
- **API**: T400-T401 (2 tasks)
- **Safety**: T500-T504 (5 tasks)
- **Tests**: T600-T602 (3 tasks)

## Dependencies

**External** (from dependencies.md):
- Python packages: pydantic, httpx
- External services: Google Calendar API

**Internal** (from dependencies.md):
- ProfileStore (user preferences, timezone)
- ContextRAG (relevant history)

## Architectural Considerations

**Blast Radius** (from LLD):
- If this component fails: <impact>
- Containment: Circuit breaker, fallback to cached data

**Determinism** (from LLD):
- Preview: Same inputs → same outputs (no external calls with side effects)
- Execute: Idempotent with plan_id:step:arg_hash
```

Rules:
- Map each SPEC acceptance criterion to a task phase
- Follow LLD architecture (schemas → domain → service → adapters → api)
- Include architectural safety tasks (blast radius, fault isolation, determinism)
- Reference dependencies.md for setup tasks
- Test-first: Schema tests → Service tests → Adapter tests → Contract tests
- No code changes in this phase; planning only
- Target branch: feat/<area>-<short-desc> (never main)
- Respect GLOBAL_SPEC envelopes and Preview safety (no external mutations in preview paths)
- Keep changes additive and component-agnostic where possible

Constraints:
- Only write tasks.md; do not modify code
- Do not push to main
- Each task must specify exact file path
- Tasks should be granular enough for implementer agent to execute independently
