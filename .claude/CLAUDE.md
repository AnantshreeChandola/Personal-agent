# Claude — Project Rules & Working Context

## Phase
Architecture & scaffolding. Use existing structure; do not invent new folders.

## Follow these rules
- Read `/docs/architecture/Project_HLD.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md` before making changes.
- Create a branch `feat/<short-name>`; open a PR linking the relevant spec and (if present) a draft plan in `/plans/drafts/`.
- If CI fails, keep iterating on the same branch until it’s green.
- For Python services, follow `/docs/dev/PYTHON_GUIDE.md`.

- `/docs/architecture/` — Project_HLD, GLOBAL_SPEC, PROJECT_STRUCTURE
- `/tests/` — acceptance/contract tests
- `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI gates
